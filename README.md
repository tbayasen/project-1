## This project was a group effort, done by the following: Tyrone Jouel Bay-asen, Rachel Silverthorn, Christopher Coon, and Brian Saechao.

### Who doesn’t love food?? Find the best restaurants in the area with our app Foodie! 

### Our project allows users to type in their cuisine preference in their area, or in a location they are traveling to find the restaurants in that area.  Anyone can search for cuisines in any area, however we also have a login system that will allow users to post ratings, comments and pictures after trying each restaurant.

### The motivation we had behind this was to make a website simple and easy, focused on finding food in your area-- because who doesn’t love food. Getting people out of their comfort zone, not only eating at a chinese restaurant down the street, foodie allows you to find alternatives showing how expensive restaurants are, combined with ratings and reviews of friends or users who have tried these restaurants already.
### Our results is a website that allows the specific cuisine and search given to find restaurants where you want.
